Depending on how busy ChatGPT is, an answer can take between 2 and 30+ seconds<br>
<br>
if ```usePluginCertFile``` is ```true``` in the config, the plugin uses the ```cacert.pem``` from https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem<br>

You can also set the ```useInsecureConnection``` to ```true``` to disable SSL verification.<br>

### few-shot learning ‚öôÔ∏è

In addition, certain dynamic data from the server, such as the player name or the number of online players, can be taught to the model.<br>
The initialPrompt default only serves as an example. users should customise it according to their needs by editing the file.<br>
