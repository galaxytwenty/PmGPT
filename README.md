So that each user can have his own conversation. This plugin saves the chat history with ChatGPT in a .txt file<br>

The user can delete this file himself for private reasons.<br>
<br>
if usePluginCertFile is true in the config, the plugin uses the cacert.pem from https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem<br>

Only users with ```pmgpt.use``` permission can run the command ```/chatgpt```<br>
Depending on how busy ChatGPT is, an answer can take between 2 and 30+ seconds<br>

### few-shot learning ‚öôÔ∏è
After you have started the server for the first time, you will find a file called initialPrompt.yml in the plugin_data/PmGPT folder.<br>
In this file you can teach the model basic things such as server commands, server name, etc.<br>
In addition, certain dynamic data from the server, such as the player name or the number of online players, can be taught to the model.<br>
You can find more information in the initialPrompt.yml file.<br>
